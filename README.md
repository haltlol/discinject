Run any cmd command on discord startup

* the only thing you have to know is that <link> should be replaced with a direct link to an exe which is called discord.exe.
* Or change discord.exe in the js injection.
* Or change the code you can change the command that's being run in the js injection section and actually remove the whole requests part.
